When you apply a brake in a vehicle, it stops the vehicle.  The method brake() represents the behavior of stopping the vehicle.
The car brake is applied by the log and the cycle brake is applied by hand.  The way of operating is different, but the desired behavior is on and the same.
Similarly, we can define multiple methods with the same name in a class.  If the behavior of more than one method with the same name does the same thing on varying number of parameters or varying
types of parameters, it is called overloading in java. 
 
  
method overloading - po`mlymorphism
 declare multiple methods with same name but different parameter in same class.
